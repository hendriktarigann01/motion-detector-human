## Building



## Pull Requests

* Name your branch something that is descriptive to the work you are doing. i.e. adds-new-thing or fixes-mobile
* If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
* If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
* If you make visual changes, screenshots are required.
* Ensure the test suite passes.
* Ensure that you deal with any lint warnings.
* If you refactor the existing code, please let us know in your PR description.
* A PR description and title are required. Make sure to use the commit message convention.
* [Link to an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls) in the project. Unsolicited code is welcomed, but an issue is required for announce your intentions. PR's without a linked issue will be marked invalid and closed.

### PR Validation

Examples for valid PR titles:

- fix: Correct typo.

_Note that since PR titles only have a single line, you have to use the ! syntax for breaking changes._
